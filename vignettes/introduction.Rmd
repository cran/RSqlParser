RSqlParser is a non-validating sql paser. It can be used to get various components of sql statements.

```{r setup}
library(RSqlParser)
```
## Methods

There are currently 4 methods in the package:
```
get_all_bind_variables:	Get the bind variables in sql.
get_all_select_cols_with_alias:	Get the names of the selected columns in the sql
get_all_subqueries:	Get the subqueries in sql.
get_all_tables_with_alias:	Get the names of the tables with alias present in the sql

```

## Note
```
This is a non-validating module. It expects syntactically correct sql statements.

Currently, it supports only SELECT statements.

get_all_subqueries does not return nested sub queries. To retreive nested subquery, the subquery of the main select query needs to be passed in this method again.

```
